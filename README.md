A lightweight tool to detect potentially **fake banking APKs** using rule-based analysis on APK metadata,
permissions, certificates, and YARA string scanning.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts APK metadata (package name, certificates, permissions)
- Matches against **trusted bank certificates** (from `known_banks.yaml`)
- Applies rule-based scoring engine (`rules.py`)
- Scans APK with YARA signatures (`strings.yar`)
- Generates risk score and reasons

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

To scan an APK:
```bash
python src/scan_apk.py path/to/app.apk
```

Example output:
```
Risk Score: 8
Reasons:
- Suspicious permission: SEND_SMS
- Certificate not in known banks list
```
